                    The problem
                </h2>

                <p>
                    After successfully redeveloping their public website in 2018 (another Tundra project), Slater and Gordon experienced an influx of enquiries through to their call centre. Limited resourcing due to tightened budgets meant they were unable to deal with the
                    volume of enquiries, leaving some prospective clients waiting in a time of great stress and need.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>
                        Slater and Gordon's redeveloped website was sending too many people to their customer service team. A good problem to have, but one that still needed a solution.

                <h2>
                    The plan
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Create an online legal triage tool that helps a prospective client understand whether or not they have a claim and make an appointment with a suitable lawyer in their area.</p>
                <p>
                    I was engaged as part of the team at Tundra to design this tool, handing development responsibilities over to another external agency, Argo Logic.

                <h2>
                    Discover
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first step, as always, was to gather as much information as possible and explore requirements. In this case, we not only needed to explore business and user needs, but legal and regulatory requirements too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this, I met with Slater and Gordon’s experts in Motor Vehicle Accidents, Workers Compensation claims, and Public Liability to understand the questions that must be asked of prospective clients to tell whether or not their claim might be valid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This process uncovered a huge amount of complexity that our triage tool would need to cater for. A prospective client could reach quite a number of different outcomes (requiring different appointment types — or no appointment at all) based on their combination
                    of answers to the necessary questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final part of our discovery phase was to gather and document detailed business requirements for the appointment-booking portion of the tool. As the tool was also being built in Salesforce, we had to explore the technical constraints that might also
                    impact our design.
                </p>



                <h2>
                    Define
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following our discovery phase, it was time to turn all of our complex and detailed requirements and information into designs.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Draft questionnaire and logic flow
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My first step was to create the draft questionnaires that would ask the right questions of users, in a way they'd understand, to get them to the answers and outcomes they needed. These draft questionnaires mapped the questions as well as the questionnaire
                    logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These were a fundamental first step. Working closely with Slater and Gordon's legal experts, we were able to ensure we were meeting regulatory requirements prior to spending valuable design time going back and forth on the fine print.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time these were complete, I'd written questionnaires for 3 legal practices (motor vehicle accidents, workers compensation and public liability), in 5 different jurisdictions.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Visual user flows
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once the questionnaires were compliant with loca laws and signed off, I turned my attention to documenting the detailed logic underpinning the questionnaire by creating user flows. These detailed maps of questionnaire paths were a vital artefact for both
                    the interface design to come, as well as Argo's technical implementation team.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Wireframing the interface
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Thanks to the detailed work I'd completed early on to finalise the questionnaire and its logic, I was able to move into wireframing knowing exactly what the tool needed to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I explored a range of common interface patterns including a chat-bot-like question and answer format, a TypeForm/survey-like interface, and many more.</p>

                <p> Ultimately, after closely considering the sensitive and legal nature of the tool, I landed on a simple multi-page form format with a progress tracker, as this gave people more information and help when it was required, better visual feedback
                    throughout the process, and simpler and more widely understood patterns of interaction.

                    Test
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before moving into high-fidelity UI design, we wanted to validate our thinking by testing the solution with real prospective clients. We could not responsibly hand our designs over for development until we'd done so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We opted to develop a simple working prototype using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This was simpler and more effective, as recreating the complex questionnaire logic and detailed calendar-booking interactions in clickable wireframes actually involved more work
                    for a less realistic outcome. This work was completed by our front-end developer Abe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then tested the prototype with 10 prospective clients (5 who had been involved in a motor vehicle accident, and 5 who had suffered an injury while at work). I observed their use of the prototype, probing for pain points and opportunities to improve.
                    I also explored user comprehension of the questionnaire survey to ensure we'd got the language right and made the process as clear as possible.

                <p>
                    From this testing, we took away a number of interesting insights, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users got confused by some of the complex legal terminology that had to be included for compliance reasons, despite 'help' text being available. We needed to make help easier to find.</li>
                    <li>While users were able to easily interact with the tool to answer the questionnaire and book their appointment, most had concerns around the cost of an appointment and what they needed to do to prepare for it.</li>
                    <li>Users wanted to know more about the list of potential lawyers they could choose to make a booking with. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    From here, we went away and improved the tool based upon our insights and ran another round of testing with 10 more participants. Results from this second round of testing highlighted further improvements but were overwhelmingly positive, safely leading
                    us into the final high fidelity UI design of the tool.

                    In its first week after being launched to the public, the lawyers available for online bookings were fully booked with qualified prospective clients for the following month, and reliance on the call centre team had been drastically reduced. To this day,
                    performance of the tool remains incredibly strong, and further optimisation and expansion of it is planned.

                </h2>
                <p> This was an amazing project to work on, as it directly improved access to justice for Australians who were suffering through difficult times.</p>

                <p>I learned that no matter how hard you try and empathise, nothing will ever come close to the impact that can be made when designing products with direct input from the people who need to use them.</p>

                <p>Due to the legal complexity and emotional sensitivity of the material, I learned to become far more comfortable with the fact that I know nothing, and that's completely OK, freeing in fact. Since becoming more comfortable with that, my
                    work has improved ten-fold. I'm asking more questions and exploring a wider range of design possibilities than I ever did before. </p>

                <p>The tools we have at our disposal as design practitioners can get us very close, but if we assume we've learned everything, we veer into dangerous territory and close ourselves off from so many new, exciting and more appropriate possibilities.</p>

                    What I'd change
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I were to do this all over again, I'd have loved to have had the time and budget to bring prospective clients into the process earlier, to more closely understand their emotional and informational needs early on, and to co-design the experience from
                    the ground up with them. While I'm satisfied our rounds of prototype testing enabled us to incorporate their needs appropriately, their involvement throughout the entire project would have been beneficial.

            Clarity trumps consistency. - Steve Krug :) Good design, when done well, should be invisible. - Jared Spool :) No matter how cool your interface, it would be better if there were less of it. - Alan Cooper :) To design an easy-to-use interface, pay attention
            to what users do, not what they say. - Jakob Nielsen :) Design is about 3 dimensions & the 5 senses. - Danielle Sacks :) If there is a 'trick' to it, the UI is wrong. - Douglas Anderson :) One should aim not at being possible to understand,
            but at being impossible to misunderstand. - Quintilian :) Good UX is good business. - Andrew Kucheriavy :) What's dangerous is when designers use a language that people don't understand. - Paula Scher :) You can find more problems in half
            a day than you can fix in a month. - Steve Krug :) One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand expert opinions. - Grace Hopper :) As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product. - Jeff Raskin :) Usability testing
            is the killing field of cherished notions. - David Orr :) Our websites are fluid, so our processes & workflows need to match - Brad Frost :) Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning. - Bill Gates :) Supposing is good,
            but finding out is better. - Mark Twain :)
